## MSA Project
We create a web-based appointment booking system that allows patients to book appointments with doctors, doctors to manage their schedules, and an admin to oversee the entire operation. The goal is to provide a centralized platform for managing appointments efficiently and securely.
### 1. Project Proposal

**Problem Statement:** 
Many clinics and hospitals face challenges in managing patient appointments, leading to inefficiencies, missed bookings, and administrative burdens.

**Proposed Solution:**
The software will provide an online appointment booking platform with three user levels: Patient, Doctor, and Admin. Patients can book and manage appointments online, doctors can view and update their schedules, and admins have full control over the system, including the ability to manage doctor profiles and appointments. The solution will also include online payment integration for convenience.

**Target Audience:**
- Patients who want to book and manage appointments online easily.
- Doctors who need an organized system to handle their schedules and track earnings.
- Hospitals/Clinics that require a centralized appointment management system to reduce administrative workload.

**Tools & Technologies:**
- Frontend: React.js for a responsive and dynamic user interface.
- Backend: Node.js with Express.js for server-side operations.
- Database: MongoDB for storing user and appointment data.
- Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure authentication.
- Payment Integration: Stripe or PayPal for online payments.
- Styling: TailwindCSS or Bootstrap for quick and adaptive styling.

### 2. Requirements Gathering
**Functional Requirements:**
- User Registration: Patients, doctors, and admins can register and log in.
- User Dashboard: Different dashboards for patients, doctors, and admins.
- Appointment Booking: Patients can view available time slots and book appointments.
- Profile Management: Doctors can update their profiles, set availability, and view earnings.
- Admin Panel: Manage users, appointments, and doctors' profiles.
- Payment Integration: Patients can pay for appointments online.
- Notifications: Email or SMS notifications for appointment confirmations.
  
**Non-Functional Requirements:**
- Security: Encrypted communication, secure user data storage.
- Scalability: Able to handle a growing number of users and appointments.
- Usability: Simple and intuitive interface for all users.
- Performance: Fast response times, particularly during peak booking periods.
- Reliability: High uptime and minimal disruptions.
  
**Use Cases/User Stories:**
As a Patient, I want to create an account so I can book appointments with doctors.
As a Doctor, I want to log in to view my appointment schedule and update my availability.
As an Admin, I want to manage all users and oversee appointments to ensure everything runs smoothly.
As a Patient, I want to pay for my appointment online securely and get a confirmation.
As a Doctor, I want to track my earnings from completed appointments.

### 3. High-Level Architecture
**Objective:**
Create a structured system that supports user management, secure authentication, and efficient data handling.

**Architecture:**
- N-Layer Architecture (best for maintainability and scalability):
  - Frontend: React.js (User Interface Layer)
  - Backend: Node.js + Express (Business Logic Layer)
  - Database: MongoDB (Data Layer)
  - APIs: RESTful APIs for interaction between frontend and backend.
- Architecture Diagram:
  - Frontend connects to Backend via API.
  - Backend communicates with the Database.
  - Payment Service for handling transactions.
  - Notification Service for sending alerts.
